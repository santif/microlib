# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze the gRPC server test timeout issue
  - Examine the stack trace to identify the deadlock location
  - Review the server implementation to understand the synchronization mechanism
  - Identify the specific cause of the deadlock in the shutdown process
  - _Requirements: 2.1_

- [x] 2. Fix the deadlock in the Shutdown method
  - Modify the Shutdown method to avoid calling Address() while holding the write lock
  - Store the server address in a local variable before acquiring the lock
  - Ensure proper lock ordering throughout the method
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.2, 3.2_

- [x] 3. Implement proper resource cleanup during shutdown
  - Ensure all connections are properly closed
  - Verify that all goroutines are terminated
  - Add appropriate logging for shutdown progress
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 4. Add timeout handling for forced shutdown
  - Implement a mechanism to force shutdown if graceful shutdown exceeds timeout
  - Add appropriate logging for timeout events
  - Ensure all resources are released even in forced shutdown
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.4_

- [x] 5. Update and enhance tests
  - Fix the TestStartAndShutdown test to verify it completes within a reasonable time
  - Add additional test cases for concurrent shutdown scenarios
  - Add test for timeout-triggered forced shutdown
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.3_

- [x] 6. Verify and document the fix
  - Run the full test suite to ensure no regressions
  - Document the issue and fix in code comments
  - Update any relevant documentation
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_
