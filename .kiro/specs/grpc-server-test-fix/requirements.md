# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MicroLib Go framework is experiencing a test timeout issue in the gRPC server implementation. The `TestStartAndShutdown` test is timing out after 10 minutes, indicating a potential deadlock or resource leak in the server's shutdown process. This feature aims to identify and fix the issue to ensure reliable and efficient testing of the gRPC server component.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the MicroLib framework, I want the gRPC server tests to run reliably and efficiently, so that I can have confidence in the framework's stability and avoid long test execution times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `TestStartAndShutdown` test is executed THEN the system SHALL complete the test within a reasonable time frame (under 10 seconds)
2. WHEN the gRPC server is shut down THEN the system SHALL release all resources properly
3. WHEN multiple tests are run in sequence THEN the system SHALL not experience resource leaks between tests
4. IF a shutdown operation takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL log appropriate warnings and force shutdown after the timeout

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a framework maintainer, I want to understand and fix the root cause of the gRPC server test timeout, so that I can ensure the framework is robust and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the code THEN the system SHALL identify the specific cause of the test timeout
2. WHEN implementing the fix THEN the system SHALL address the root cause rather than just working around the symptoms
3. WHEN the fix is implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality
4. IF the fix requires changes to the public API THEN the system SHALL document these changes clearly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the gRPC server to handle graceful shutdown correctly, so that my services can terminate cleanly without resource leaks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server is shut down THEN the system SHALL close all active connections properly
2. WHEN the server is shut down THEN the system SHALL release all locks and mutexes
3. WHEN the server is shut down THEN the system SHALL cancel all ongoing operations
4. IF the graceful shutdown exceeds the configured timeout THEN the system SHALL force shutdown
