# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the MicroLib framework. ADRs document important architectural decisions made during the development of the framework.

## ADR Template

When creating new ADRs, use the following template:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context

[Describe the context and problem statement]

## Decision

[Describe the decision made]

## Consequences

[Describe the consequences of the decision, both positive and negative]

## Alternatives Considered

[List alternatives that were considered and why they were rejected]
```

## Guidelines

- ADRs should be numbered sequentially
- Each ADR should focus on a single architectural decision
- ADRs should be written in a clear, concise manner
- Include rationale for the decision and alternatives considered
- Update the index when adding new ADRs
