# ADR-003: Observability Integration Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Modern microservices require comprehensive observability including structured logging, metrics collection, distributed tracing, and health checking. These concerns should be integrated seamlessly without requiring extensive setup from developers.

Key requirements:
- Structured logging with trace correlation
- Prometheus-compatible metrics
- OpenTelemetry distributed tracing
- Health check endpoints for Kubernetes
- Automatic instrumentation of HTTP/gRPC requests
- Context propagation across service boundaries

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive observability package with the following components:

### 1. Structured Logging
- Use Go's standard `slog` package for structured logging
- JSON format by default for machine readability
- Automatic trace ID injection from context
- Configurable log levels with runtime changes

```go
type Logger interface {
    Info(msg string, fields ...Field)
    Error(msg string, err error, fields ...Field)
    WithContext(ctx context.Context) Logger
}
```

### 2. Metrics Collection
- Prometheus-compatible metrics with automatic HTTP endpoint
- Standard metrics for HTTP/gRPC requests (latency, errors, throughput)
- Custom metrics support through simple interfaces

```go
type Metrics interface {
    Counter(name string, labels ...string) Counter
    Histogram(name string, labels ...string) Histogram
    Gauge(name string, labels ...string) Gauge
}
```

### 3. Distributed Tracing
- OpenTelemetry as the standard tracing implementation
- Automatic span creation for HTTP/gRPC requests
- Context propagation using standard headers
- Integration with logging for trace correlation

### 4. Health Checking
- Kubernetes-compatible health endpoints (/health/live, /health/ready)
- Extensible health check system for dependencies
- Startup probes for complex initialization sequences

```go
type HealthChecker interface {
    AddCheck(name string, check HealthCheck)
    LivenessHandler() http.Handler
    ReadinessHandler() http.Handler
}
```

### 5. Automatic Instrumentation
- Middleware/interceptors automatically instrument HTTP/gRPC servers
- No manual instrumentation required for basic observability
- Consistent instrumentation across all services

## Consequences

### Positive
- Zero-configuration observability for basic use cases
- Consistent observability across all services
- Industry-standard tools and formats
- Automatic correlation between logs, metrics, and traces
- Kubernetes-ready health checking
- Performance insights out of the box

### Negative
- Additional dependencies and complexity
- Potential performance overhead from instrumentation
- Learning curve for teams unfamiliar with observability concepts
- Storage and processing costs for telemetry data

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Manual Instrumentation
Require developers to manually add logging, metrics, and tracing.
- **Rejected**: Leads to inconsistent implementation and developer burden

### 2. Jaeger Instead of OpenTelemetry
Use Jaeger directly for distributed tracing.
- **Rejected**: OpenTelemetry is the industry standard and vendor-neutral

### 3. Custom Metrics Format
Create a custom metrics format instead of Prometheus.
- **Rejected**: Prometheus is the de facto standard for Kubernetes environments

### 4. Text-Based Logging
Use human-readable text logging instead of structured JSON.
- **Rejected**: Structured logging is essential for automated log analysis

### 5. External Observability Agent
Use an external agent like Datadog or New Relic agent.
- **Rejected**: Creates vendor lock-in and doesn't provide the same level of integration
